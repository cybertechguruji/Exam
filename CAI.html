        <h1>Introduction to the computer</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>1. component of computer</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/component_of_computer.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>The major components of a computer are given below.</p>
            <p>The Input Device</p>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU)</p>
            <p>Output device</p>
            <p>Memory</p>
            <p>Bus</p>
            <p> The Input Device is used for feeding data to the computer. The keyboard is the standard input device.
                Other input devices are scanning devices like Bar Code Reader (BCR), Optical Mark Reader (OMR) and
                Magnetic Ink Character Reader (MICR), etc. Even there are software packages for recognizing human voice.
                Discussion on some of these devices is made in Unit 5.</p>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) consists of the Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and
                main memory. The computer processes data through step-by-step instructions stored in a program. The CU
                regulates computer operations by interpreting and carrying out instructions contained in the program.
                The ALU performs the four basic arithmetic operations (namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication and
                division) as well as logical operations, based on the comparison of two pieces of data.</p>
            <p>The Output Device is the hardware through which the computer interacts with the user. After processing
                of data, the computer displays the result through the output device. The monitor and the printer are
                output devices.</p>
            <p>The computers are used to store voluminous amount of data. The data, during processing, are stored in
                the memory of the computer. The computer can store data in binary format. Data in binary format consist
                of 0's and 1's. Any data fed through the input device is translated into binary mode before it is stored
                in the memory. The amount of memory required to store a single 0 or 1 is known as a bit. A group of
                eight bits is known as a byte. The memory of the computer is measured in bytes.</p>
            <p>The main memory of the computer is limited. Data can be transferred from some secondary storage device
                to the main memory as and when required. Secondary storage devices include the hard disk, floppy disk,
                CD ROM, magnetic tapes, etc.</p>
            <p>Bus is the electrical path through which data, in form of bits, are transmitted from one device to the
                other. A bus is normally named as per the function it performs. For example, the data bus carries data,
                Control bus carries all timing and control instructions sent by the control unit of the CPU. Address bus
                is the pathway to specific locations in the main memory of the computer. The input/output (IO) bus
                carries signal to the input/output devices.</p>

            <h2>3. software</h2>
            <p>The computer processes data as per the instructions provided for their processing. The set of
                instructions is known as the program. The set of programs through which the user interacts with the
                computer is known as software. Software used in a computer includes the following:</p>
            <p>The Operating System</p>
            <p>Language Processor</p>
            <p>Application Software</p>
            <h3>The Operating System</h3>
            <p>Computer does not understand natural language. About 50 years ago, when the computer was first put to
                use, sophisticated programs were required even for simple tasks. As a result, it was the luxury of
                handful of scientists who knew how to communicate with the computer. However, in modern computers the
                users do not have to interact with the CPU. A program through which the user interacts for getting
                his/her request processed by the CPU is known as the Operating System. The Operating System understands
                simple commands that resemble the natural language. This is primarily responsible for extensive use of
                the computer by users who do not know anything about the programming. The DOS, UNIX, Microsoft Windows,
                LINUX and OS2 are some of the common Operating Systems.</p>
            <h3>Language Processor</h3>
            <p>The operating system only has a limited set of commands. Practical applications for general purposes
                require some programming. These programs are written in some languages like assembly language or high
                level language (like C). The instructions in these languages have to be translated into machine language
                before these can be processed by the CPU. The software that translates a program written in assembly
                language is known as assembler. The program may contain a number of instructions. Every instruction
                needs to be translated into machine language. The software used for this includes,</p>
            <p>the interpreter,</p>
            <p>the compiler</p>
            <p>tIn interpreter, an instruction is translated and executed and then only the next instruction is taken up
                for translation. In compiler, all the instructions in a program are translated and stored in a separate
                file. Program can be executed by reading instructions from this file.</p>
            <h3>Application Software</h3>
            <p>Application Software comprises programs for specific application. For example, Microsoft Word is an
                application software for desktop publishing. The autoCAD is the application software for engineering
                drawings. The CorelDraw is the application software for commercial artists.</p>
            <h3>Assembler</h3>
            <p>A computer will not understand any program written in a language, other than its machine language. The
                programs written in other languages must be translated into the machine language. Such translation is
                performed with the help of software. Assembler is a computer program which is used to translate program
                written in Assembly Language (low level language) into machine language. The translated program is
                called as object program. Assembler checks each instruction for its correctness and generates diagnostic
                messages, if there are mistakes in the program. If an assembler that runs on a computer and produces the
                machine codes for other computer then it is called Cross Assembler. Assemblers are further divided into
                two types: One Pass Assembler and Two Pass Assembler. One pass assembler is the assembler which assigns
                the memory addresses to the variables and translates the source code into machine code in the first pass
                simultaneously. A Two Pass Assembler is the assembler which reads the source code twice. In the first
                pass, it reads all the variables and assigns them memory addresses. In the second pass, it reads the
                source code and translates the code into object code.</p>
            <p>Various steps of assembling are:</p>
            <p>1. Input source program in Assembly Language through an input device</p>
            <p>2. Use Assembler to produce object program in machine language</p>
            <p>3. Execute the program</p>
            <h3>Compiler</h3>
            <p>Compiler is a program which translates a high level language program into a machine language program. It
                is more intelligent than an assembler. It checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors etc. The
                corrections are to be incorporated in the program, whenever needed, and the program has to be
                recompiled. The process is repeated until the program is mistake free and translated to an object code.
                But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of the memory. It has slow speed. Because a
                compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes. If a
                compiler runs on a computer and produces the machine codes for the same computer then it is known as a
                self-compiler or resident compiler. On the other hand, if a compiler runs on a computer and produces the
                machine codes for other computer then it is known as a cross compiler.</p>
            <p>Thus the job of a complier includes the following:</p>
            <p>1. To translate HLL source program to machine codes</p>
            <p>2. To trace variables in the program</p>
            <p>3. To include linkage for subroutines</p>
            <p>4. To allocate memory for storage of program and variables</p>
            <p>5. To generate error messages, if there are errors in the program</p>
            <h3>Interpreter</h3>
            <p>An interpreter is a program which translates statements of a program into machine code. It translates
                only one statement of the program at a time. It reads only one statement of program, translates it and
                executes it. Then it reads the next statement of the program again translates it and executes it. In
                this way it proceeds further till all the statements are translated and executed. On the other hand, a
                compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes. A
                compiler is 5 to 25 times faster than an interpreter. In this case, object code is not stored and
                reused. Every time the program is executed, the interpreter translates each instruction freshly. It also
                has program diagnostic capabilities. However, it has some disadvantages as below:</p>
            <p>1. Instructions repeated in program must be translated each time they are executed.</p>
            <p>2. Because the source program is translated fresh every time it is used, it is slow process or execution
                takes more time. It is approx 20 times slower than complier.</p>
            <h3>Linker</h3>
            <p>In high level languages, some built in header files or libraries are stored. These libraries are
                predefined and these contain basic functions which are essential for executing the program. These
                functions are linked to the libraries by a program called Linker. If linker does not find a library of a
                function then it informs the compiler and then compiler generates an error. The compiler automatically
                invokes the linker as the last step in compiling a program.</p>
            <p>Not built in libraries, it also links the user defined functions to the user defined libraries. Usually a
                longer program is divided into smaller subprograms called modules. And these modules must be combined to
                execute the program. The process of combining the modules is done by the linker.</p>
            <h3>Loader</h3>
            <p>Loader is a program that loads machine codes of a program into the system memory. In Computing, a loader
                is the part of an Operating System that is responsible for loading programs. It is one of the essential
                stages in the process of starting a program. Because it places programs into memory and prepares them
                for execution. Loading a program involves reading the contents of executable file into memory. Once
                loading is complete, the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program
                code. All operating systems that support program loading have loaders. In many operating systems the
                loader is permanently resident in memory.</p>

            <h2>1.Input Device</h2>
            <p>The Input Devices may broadly be classified into the following categories.</p>
            <p>Keyboard</p>
            <p>Mouse</p>

                below.</p>
            <p>Printer</p>
            <p>Plotter</p>
            <p>Monitor</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>3.Scanner and Reader</h2>
            <p>Most commonly used Scanners and Readers are as follows.</p>
            <p>Magnetic Ink Character Reader (MICR)</p>
            <p>Optical Character Reader (OCR)</p>
            <p>Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</p>
            <h3>Magnetic Ink Character Reader(MICR)</h3>
            <p>Magnetic Ink Character Readers (MICR’s) are capable of reading documents directly in which characters are
                written using a special type of magnetic ink. The American Banking Association has standardized fonts
                for writing characters so that they can easily be read by the MICR. Sample of numeric characters written
                in this font is given in Figure 4.5.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/MICR.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>In cheques, bottom lines are written in magnetic ink, the bank's code number, customer's account number
                and the cheque number. The employees in the bank fill the amount using another machine that prints the
                amount using the same type of ink. The cheques can be processed by the machine without any further human
                interaction.</p>
            <h3>Optical Character Reader (OCR)</h3>
            <p>An Optical Character Reader (OCR), unlike MICR, can read characters written in ordinary ink. An optical
                character reader examines each character as if it was made up of a number of pixels (small spots). In
                the memory of the computer are stored patterns for various ASCII characters. The pattern corresponding
                to the character read is compared with the set of patterns stored in the memory. The character for which
                the pattern matches, or nearly matches with the pattern read is taken as the character read.</p>
            <p>Some OCR readers can read from computer printouts or from typed text. Devices have also been developed to
                read hand written documents that are written neatly using capital letters. However, hand written
                documents cannot have high accuracy.</p>
            <h3>Optical Mark Reader</h3>
            <p>Optical mark recognition is a method of computerized input from its paper forms. It is generally
                distinguished from OCR by the fact that a recognition engine is not required. In this system, the marks
                are constructed in such a way that there is little chance of not reading the marks correctly. This
                requires the image to have high contrast and an easily-recognizable shape.</p>
            <p>The document to be read by an Optical Mark Reader (OMR) is divided into boxes which can be marked using a
                soft pencil or left as it is. The document may be designed such that a combination of marks in certain
                boxes conveys some information. Evaluation of answer sheets in examinations with multiple choice
                questions is a typical application of OMR. The OMR can directly read the roll number of the students and
                their response to the questions.</p>
            <p>The advantages of OMR are obvious. It is very useful for entering data when the required information has
                limited range and can be entered by marking a combination of boxes in the pre-designed document. Here,
                data entered at the source is directly fed to the computer without any human interaction at any other
                point. However, it is required to design the document known as the coding sheet before data can be
                entered. Changes to this document are rather an expensive proposition.</p>

            <h2>4. Printer</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/printer.png" alt=""></div>
            <h3>Impact Printer</h3>
            <p>In impact printers, the print head strikes an inked ribbon located between the print head and the paper.
                The general features of impact printers are given below.</p>
            <p>It uses force by applying hammer pins to strike the paper </p>
            <p>It is slow in characters per second.</p>
            <p>Multiple copies may be printed at once.</p>
            <p>The main types of impact printers are Line Printer, and Character Printer.</p>
            <h3>non-impact printers</h3>
            <p>In non-impact printers, the print head does not make contact with the paper, and no inked ribbon is
                necessary. The general features of non-impact printers are given hereunder.</p>
            <p>Print head does not make contact with the paper.</p>
            <p>It has higher speed.</p>
            <p>The three main types of non-impact printers are Laser-jet, Ink-jet and Thermal.</p>
            <h3>Line Printer</h3>
            <p>Line Printers are of two types, namely,</p>
            <p>Drum Printers, and</p>
            <p>Chain Printers.</p>
            <h3>Drum Printer</h3>
            <p>In a Drum Printer, characters are embossed on a cylindrical drum. The common drum has a set of 96
                characters. The drum has 132 columns and all the 96 characters embossed on each column (around the
                circumference of the drum). A set of hammers, one for each column, is placed in a line. Between the set
                of hammers and the drum is placed the paper for printing along with a carbon ribbon. The drum rotates at
                very high speed. During a full rotation of the drum, at some time or other, the character to be printed
                will come under the drum. Exactly at this time the hammer strikes the drum and the character on which
                the hammer strikes will be printed on the paper. One full rotation of the drum will print one full line.
                Note that the drum rotates at high speed. Thus, it is essential that the hammer must be very accurately
                synchronized with the movement of the drum. Since the replica of the character on the drum is reproduced
                on the paper, one can not select the font. The font is determined by the drum itself.</p>
            <h3>Chain Printer</h3>
            <p>A line printer of chain type consists of a steel band with character embossed on it. As in drum type
                printer, the paper and ribbon is placed between the band and the set of hammers. The band rotates at
                high speed. The hammers are synchronized with the movement of the band and strike the band when the
                character to be printed comes under it.</p>
            <h3>Character Printer</h3>
            <p>A Character Printer prints one character after another as the print head moves across a line. The
                Character Printers of common use are the Dot Matrix Printer and the Daisy-wheel Printer.</p>
            <h3>Dot Matrix Printer</h3>
            <p>The Dot Matrix Printer is the most popular character printer. The print head of a dot matrix printer has
                a rectangular array of pins. Depending upon the character to be printed, only selected pins are
                activated and fire against a carbon ribbon under which the paper is placed. For example, letter H is
                printed by firing pins as shown in Figure 4.7.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/dot_matrix.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Thus, a character printed by a dot matrix printer will consists of a number of small dots, which
                collectively will give the impression of a character. The quality of printing will be determined by the
                number of pins in the print head. A 9 pin printer (9 pins in a vertical line) is most common (Figure
                4.7). Capital letters are printed in matrices of 7x5. The other two pins are used to form descenders of
                some lower case letters like p,q etc. Dot matrix printers with 21 and 24 pins are also available. They
                give better print quality as compared to 9 pin print heads.</p>
            <h3>Daisy-wheel Printer</h3>
            <p>The print head of the Daisy-wheel Printer looks like a daisy flower. It has a number of print arms each
                with a solid character at its end. The character to be printed is stored in a buffer. The hub on which
                the print head is mounted rotates at high speed. As in a dot matrix hammer, a hammer strikes when the
                character to be printed comes under it. Under the print head is the paper below a carbon ribbon. When
                the hammer strikes the character on the print arm the impression of the character is reproduced on the
                paper. Figure 4.9 shows the picture of a daisy wheel.</p>

            <h3>Laser-jet Printer</h3>
            <p>The principle of operation of a Laser-jet printer is given below.</p>
            <p>The information to be printed is sent from the computer to the printer.</p>
            <p>The printer converts the print information into a series of "ON" and "OFF" commands corresponding to
                pulses of light.</p>
            <p>The pulses of light are reflected to a light sensitive drum and a horizontal line is drawn on the drum.
            </p>
            <p>After a line is drawn on the drum, it rotates a little, positioning itself for the next horizontal line.
            </p>
            <p>The drum is usually charged negatively. When a pulse of light hits the drum, it creates a dot of positive
                charge. Thus, the drum contains dots charged positively or negatively, depending upon the intensity of
                light pulses it has received.</p>
            <p>The drum rotates past a container bin, which contains toner charged negatively that is attracted to the
                positive areas on the drums surface. Thus, the drum contains a replica of what is needed to be printed.
            </p>
            <p>Paper is drawn into the printer and charged positively electrically. The toner attached to the drum is
                transferred to the printer and is fused by application of heat in a fusion chamber.</p>
            <p>Laser printing is used extensively for high quality, high volume and noise-less operation. Laser printers
                can print up to 40 pages/minute. Figure 4.10 shows a Laser-jet printer.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/laser.png" alt=""></div>
            <h3>Ink Jet Printers</h3>
            <p>The Ink-jet printer prints by accurately spraying droplets of a controlled stream of ink on the paper.
                Ink is stored in a container known as the cartridge. There are many ways in which the ink may be forced
                out of cartridge for printing. One simple technique is thermal heating. In this method, ink is heated
                till it is vapourized. This forces the ink to come out of the cartridge.</p>
            <p>The print head of a popular model of Hewlett-Packard Ink-jet printer has twelve tiny holes arranged
                vertically facing the paper. As the print head moves horizontally, the droplets of Ink-jet are shot
                wherever required. Behind each hole is a small heating element which, when turned on, vapourizes the ink
                rapidly causing a force inside the ink cartridge (the container which stores the ink). As a result, the
                ink is ejected from the cartridge</p>
            <p>Another type of printer head is based on the principle that when current is passed through a
                piezoelectric crystal, it expands. The expansion of the piezoelectric crystal is utilized to build
                pressure in the cartridge and force ink out of it. The Ink-jet printers are inexpensive and produce less
                noise. Inexpensive Ink-jet printers are also available for printing coloured images. Figure 4.11 shows
                an Ink-jet printer.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/inkjet.png" alt=""></div>
            <h3>Thermal Printers</h3>
            <p>The head of the Thermal Printer, like that of the dot matrix printer, has a number of pins. A selected
                set of pins may be activated to print a given character. Unlike the dot matrix printer, there is no
                impact force of the hammer over the character to be printed. Here, the actuated pin heats the paper. The
                paper is heat sensitive and as a result the impression of the character formed by the activated pins is
                transmitted to the heat sensitive paper.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>File Management</h2>
            <p>Data are stored in the hard disk in the form of files. The operating system keeps track of all the files
                in the disk by creating a File Allocation Table (FAT). The FAT contains information about the names of
                the file, the type, size and address of each file. The data can be retrieved from a file through a
                reference to its address.</p>
            <p>The disk is divided into a number of directories. Each directory may have a number of sub-directories.
                The operating system enables the user to,</p>
            <p>Create a directory</p>
            <p>Create a file in any sub-directory</p>
            <p>Open a file for reading or writing</p>

        <h1>Computer Network</h1>
        <article>
            <h3>Definition of Networking</h3>
            <p>A computer network is a collection of interconnected independent computers. An independent computer is
                one which may share data, hard disk or even CPU with other systems at a far off palace, but which work
                independently according to the wish of its user. The interconnection may be either direct or indirect.
                In direct connection, two or more computers are linked through wires (twisted pair, cable, coaxial cable
                or optical fibre cable) whereas in indirect connection the linkage is through microwaves or
                communication satellites. Two or more computers connected directly or indirectly can exchange
                information between them. In a computer network, many computers are connected together and the user is
                fully aware of it. A user can work with any computer, and s/he can move files from one system to the
                other and thereby can control the complete network.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Networking</h3>
            <h4>Resource Sharing</h4>
            <p>A stand-alone computer can use hardware or peripherals attached to it. However, a computer connected to a
                network can use hardware and peripherals connected to any system in the network. It can use software or
                data stored in any system connected to the network.</p>
            <h4>Improved Reliability</h4>
            <p>A centralized computer system serving an organization is much less reliable than networked system. This
                is because in networked system one may have alternative sources of supply. For example, assume a line
                printer is connected to the computer and because of some reasons the same is out of order. If the system
                is a part of a network, it is possible to print the documents or reports by using the line printer which
                is connected to another system at a far-off place.</p>
            <h4>Financial Benefits</h4>
            <p>Small computers have competitive price/performance ratio as compared to large ones. A mainframe computer
                may be about ten times faster than a PC, but it may cost about a hundred times more. As a result, most
                of the organizations prefer to maintain a computer network consisting of a set of personal computers
                rather than centralized large computers.</p>
            <h4>Better Communication Medium</h4>
            <p>In an organization, with a number of branches at far off places, networking of computers facilitates easy
                mode of communication with a reasonably lesser cost. No other channel of communication, other than
                telephone, is as quick as computer network. Only limited communication is possible through telephone.
                But through the computer network, it is possible to transfer instantly any information to any other
                destination. Whenever a user updates a file, it is on-line visible to other users logged into the
                network. Thus computer network provides a better communication medium among the people posted in
                far-flung branches of an organization.</p>
            <h4>Access to Remote Database</h4>
            <p>By making access to remote database, it is possible to get all the advantages of a database system. The
                data of the organization are available at a single place and every user can retrieve data relevant to
                his/her workplace from the database. This leads to data reliability and duplication of work is
                eliminated.</p>
            <h2>Computer Network Type</h2>
            <h3>Local Area Networks (LANs)</h3>
            <p>A group of interconnected computers located in a confined area, such as, an office, a building or a
                campus is called the Local Area Network (LAN). The basic purpose of LAN is to share resources. Resources
                to be shared may be hardware, such as, printer, plotter, or software resources, such as, data,
                information, programs, etc.</p>
            <h3>Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)</h3>
            <p>A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a network spread over an entire city and uses the LAN technology.
                For example, cable television and networks spread over a city are metropolitan area analogy networks.
                The MAN is also used for sharing hardware and software resources.</p>
            <h3>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</h3>
            <p>The Wide Area Network (WAN) consists of computers separated by large distances varying from tens to
                hundreds of kilometers. The WANs are normally used to link computers to facilitate fast and efficient
                exchange of information at lesser cost and high speed.</p>
            <h2>Network Topology</h2>
            <p>Network Topology is the way the nodes are connected in a network. The way the nodes are connected is
                decided by a number of factors, which affect the overall efficiency of the network. Some of these are
                network cost, network flexibility and network reliability. It is always desired that the network should
                be cost effective. It should strike a compromise between the performance and the cost of maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>The most important factor is the distance from one node to the other. This determines the length of the
                communication channel. The topology should be such that the nodes are connected with the minimum length
                of cable. This will reduce the total cost of networking. Network topology must be flexible enough to
                accommodate changes in the system. Insertion of new nodes should be easy. The network must be highly
                reliable. Reliability means fault-free operation of the network. Network topology should be such that if
                one node is down, network performance should not be affected badly. Finally, the network must have some
                systems for fault finding and maintenance.</p>
            <p>Linear Bus Topology</p>
            <p>Star Topology</p>
            <p>Ring Topology</p>
            <p>Tree Topology</p>
            <h3>Linear Bus Topology</h3>
            <p>In Linear Bus Topology, there is a single long communication channel (normally a coaxial cable) called
                'back-bone' to which all the nodes are connected through small cable segments called 'drop-cables'. Both
                the ends of the backbone cable are terminated with the help of absorbers which absorb the signal after
                it has through all the devices. Each node contains a Network Interface Unit (NIU) which recognizes its
                address from the packet of data being transmitted by other nodes. Every node grabs the packet and checks
                whether it is to be retained or passed on to appropriate destination. In the later case, the packet once
                again is put on the backbone cable. The structure of a Linear Bus Topology is shown in Figure 11.11.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/linearbus.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>The advantages of this topology are given below:</p>
            <p>Low cabling cost because total length of the cable is relatively small.</p>
            <p>The layout of cables is simple.</p>
            <p>New nodes can be inserted in the network without disturbing either the network or an individual node.</p>
            <p>The disadvantages of this topology are also given hereunder.</p>
            <p>At a time only one message can travel through the back-bone cable.</p>
            <p>Since all nodes attempt to put their messages on the common line (back bone), the possibility of
                collision is high.</p>
            <p>Very unreliable topology (due to a break in the backbone cable) can disrupt functioning of the whole
                network.</p>
            <p>Since each node is directly connected to the central bus, it is desirable to assign priorities and select
                the user who gets preference over others.</p>
            <h3>Star Topology</h3>
            <p>In "Star Topology" all the nodes are directly connected to the central node which is known as 'Hub'.
                Nodes are connected to the hub through drop cables, which extend in all directions. Data from a node
                travel to the central node (Hub) via drop cable, and again from hub to the destination node through drop
                cable. The schematic representation of a "Star Topology" is shown in Figure 11.12.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/star.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>The "Star Topology" has some advantages. If a node is down, the working of the other nodes of the network
                is not affected. The central node has all the drop cables connected to it, so maintenance is easy.
                However, if the central node crashes due to any reason, complete network is down. As compared to Bus
                Topology, the Star Topology requires more cabling.</p>
            <h3>Ring Topology</h3>
            <p>In "Ring Topology" each node is connected to only two neighbouring nodes through cables (either twisted
                pair or co-axial). A node receives data from one neighbouring node and transmits it to the next node.
                The schematic representation of a Ring Topology is shown in Figure 11.13.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/ring.png" alt=""></div>
            <p> --Some of the advantages of Ring Topology are given below:
            </p>
            <p>Since at a time only one node transmits data, there is no chance of collision.</p>
            <p>Separate repeaters are not required.</p>
            <p>--Some of the disadvantages of ring topology are given hereunder:</p>
            <p>If any one of the nodes in the network fails, the complete network goes down.</p>
            <p>Insertion of a new node is possible without disrupting the entire network.</p>
            <p>Finding out the faulty node will require examining a series of nodes.</p>
            <h3>Tree Topology</h3>
            <p>In "Tree Topology" separate branches are added to the main original bus. There is no need to remove a
                data packet from the network as it is absorbed as soon as it reaches to the end of the medium. Tree
                Topology is best suited where there is a hierarchical flow of the data and control. Figure 11.14 shows
                pictorially the view of a Tree topology system.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/tree.png" alt=""></div>
            <h2>OSI model</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="/image/OSI.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Physical Layer</p>
            <p>Design issues which are dealt at the "Physical Layer" level are concerned mostly with the mechanical,
                electrical and procedural interfaces and the physical transmission medium. Protocols at this layer are
                primarily established to define the voltage level which represent 0 and 1, data transfer rate, timing
                for which a bit lasts and rules for handshaking between communicating nodes. All these points for which
                protocols are required are basically concerned with how bits are transmitted over the communication
                channel.</p>
            <p>Data Link Layer</p>
            <p>While physical layer is concerned with transmission of raw data bit over the commercial channel, the
                "Data Link Layer" organizes raw data into packets or frames and transmits the sequence of such packets.
                A data packet is formed by including specified number of bits (data) within special bit pattern. If a
                packet is transmitted and no corresponding acknowledgment is received back within some fixed amount of
                time, then the packet is re-transmitted. A set of standard protocols deals with damage, loss, duplicate
                frames, time limit of acknowledgment, re-transmission of frame, etc.</p>
            <p>Network Layer</p>
            <p>The main issue which is considered at this layer is routing of packet from source to the destination
                node. The "Network Layer" should also take care of congestion, which may occur when too many packets are
                transmitted at the same time. Thus, protocols are written for establishing, maintaining, and terminating
                connections between various nodes in the network.</p>
            <p>Transport Layer</p>
            <p>The "Transport Layer" takes care of delivery of error free data packets in proper sequence with no losses
                or duplication. Protocols for extensive error control are written. If the data are not delivered
                correctly, this layer informs the higher layers to take the responsibility of informing the user or the
                application program.</p>
            <p>Session Layer</p>
            <p>The "Session Layer" manages the dialogue control between the communicating nodes by allowing simplex,
                half duplex or full duplex modes of communication. If the half duplex mode of communication is permitted
                then this layer keeps the track of whose turn it is to communicate. Synchronization and priority
                assignment to the communicating node is also done at this layer level.</p>
            <p>Presentation Layer</p>
            <p>The "Presentation Layer" deals with actual grammatical rules and the meaning of the information
                transmitted. This layer transforms the data into some mutually agreed upon specific codes and then
                present these encoded data to the destination node. Thus, the encoding and the decoding is done by the
                presentation layer. Since different nodes may have different encoding schemes, it is desired that
                encoded data must be converted to some common codes which will be common for all the systems in the
                network.</p>
            <p>Application Layer</p>
            <p>Functions performed by the "Application Layer" include handling of incompatibility of various network
                nodes, file transfer, electronic mail, directory work-up and other general purpose and specific purpose
                facilities. Thus, this layer deals with application of the network, that is, different facilities
                provided by the network.</p>
            <h2>Client Server Model</h2>
            <p>A "Client" is a device, process or application, which requests for some kind of facility or resource. A
                Server is a device, process or application, which can provide the requested facility or resource. For
                example, consider a network in which many computers are connected. Suppose all, except one of the
                computers, are diskless. All files are, therefore, stored on a single disk fitted to one of the systems
                in the network. Since this computer serves the entire file, requests one may call it file-server. In
                this network system, clients (diskless computers) access their data by sending the request to the server
                (computer with disk), which carries out the work and sends back the replies.</p>
            <p>In this kind of environment data, communication takes place through requests initiated by clients. This
                kind of model is called a "client-server model" of networking. For implementation of client-server model
                sessions between clients and servers are established.</p>
            <p>The communication between the client and the server takes place through the following steps:</p>
            <p>Client places the request for resource in the format desired by the application protocol.</p>
            <p>The application protocol sends the request to the server in the form of a message across the network</p>
            <p>Upon receiving the request, server interprets and locates the desired information/resources.</p>
            <p>Server sends its reply to the application protocol, which in turn sends it to the client.</p>
