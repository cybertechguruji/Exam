            <h2> Time-Temperature Transformation (TTT) Diagram</h2>
            <p>The time-temperature transformation (TTT) curves correspond to the start and finish of transformations,
                which
                extend into the range of temperatures where austenite transforms to pearlite. Above 550°C, austenite
                transforms completely to pearlite. Below 550°C, both pearlite and bainite are formed and below 450°C,
                only
                bainite is formed. The horizontal lines that run between the two curves, as shown in Figure 6.2, marks
                the
                beginning and end of isothermal transformations. The TTT diagrams provide a good starting point for an
                examination of hardenability, but as they are statements of the kinetics of transformation of austenite
                carried out isothermally, they can only be rough guides. To take an example, the TTT diagrams for a
                0.4%C
                0.2% Mo steel and steel with 0.3%C 2% Mo show that the 0.2% Mo steel begins to transform in about one
                second
                at 550°C, but on increasing the molybdenum to 2%, the whole C-curve is raised and the reaction slowed
                substantially so that the nose is above 700°C, the reaction starting after four minutes. The latter
                steel
                will clearly have a greatly enhanced hardenability over that of the 0.2 Mo steel.</p>

            <h2>Constant-Cooling-Temperature (CCT) Diagram</h2>
            <p>The Constant-Cooling-Temperature (CCT) diagram, as shown in Figure 6.3, describe the transformations
                taking place at various constant cooling rates. The later diagrams resemble more closely the conditions
                during the actual production process of the steel or during its heat treatment at a later stage. The CCT
                diagrams provide not only the information on the transformation start and finish conditions, but also on
                the resulting hardness and microstructures for each particular cooling curve.
