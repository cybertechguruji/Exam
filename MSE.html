            <h2>Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagram</h2>
            <p>In iron-carbon system, carbon is present either in the form of free carbon (graphite) or as iron carbide
                (Fe3C). Figure 6.1 shows the equilibrium diagram for combinations of carbon in a solid solution of iron.
                The
                diagram depicts iron and carbons combined to form Fe-Fe3C (6.67C) at the end of the diagram. The left
                side
                of the diagram is pure iron combined with carbon, resulting in steel alloys. Three significant regions
                can
                be made relative to the steel portion of the diagram. They are the eutectoid, the hypo- eutectoid, and
                the
                hyper-eutectoid. The right side of the pure iron line is carbon in combination with various forms of
                iron
                called α iron (ferrite), γ iron (austenite), and δ iron. Allotropic changes take place when there is a
                change in crystal lattice structure. From 1539°C to 1394°C, the δ iron has a body centered cubic lattice
                structure. At 1394°C, the lattice changes from its body- centered cubic to a face-centered cubic lattice
                type.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="image/Fe3C.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Two imperative phase changes take place at 0.83%C and at 4.3%C. At 0.83%C, the transformation is
                eutectoid,
                called pearlite</p>
            <p>γ (austenite) → α (ferrite) + Fe3C (cementite)</p>
            <p>At 4.3% C and 1146°C, the transformation is eutectic, called ledeburite.</p>
            <p>L (liquid) → γ (austenite) + Fe3C (cementite)</p>

            <h2>Phase Diagram of Pure Water</h2>
            <p>In single component systems, there is no composition variable and the only other variables present are
                temperature and pressure. A pure substance, such as, water can exist in solid, liquid or vapour phases
                depending on the conditions of temperature and pressure as shown in Figure 3.1. The points along the
                line connecting points A and B in the phase diagram represent all combinations of temperature and
                pressure at which the solid is in equilibrium with the gas. At these temperatures and pressures, the
                rate at which the solid sublimes to form a gas is equal to the rate at which the gas condenses to form a
                solid. The solid line between points B and C is identical to the temperature dependence plot of the
                vapour pressure of the liquid. It contains all of the combinations of temperature and pressure at which
                the liquid boils. At every point along this line, the liquid boils to form a gas and the gas condenses
                to form a liquid at the same rate. The solid line between points B and D contains the combinations of
                temperature and pressure at which the solid and liquid are in equilibrium. At every point along this
                line, the solid melts at the same rate at which the liquid freezes. The BD line is almost vertical
                because the melting point of a solid is not very sensitive to changes in pressure. The slope of this
                line is slightly negative for water; as a result, water can melt at temperatures near its freezing point
                when subjected to pressure. At 100°C, the vapour pressure of water is 760 torr or 1 atm, thus at this
                temperature, water will boil, if it is at 1 atm of pressure.</p>
            <div class="img"><img src="image/water_phase.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Point B represents the only combination of temperature (0.0098°C) and pressure (4.58 torr) where solid,
                liquid and vapour phases of water coexist. It is, therefore, called the triple point, in the phase
                diagram in which all three states are in equilibrium. At pressures below 4.58 torr, water will be
                present as either a gas or solid, there can be no liquid phase. Point C is the critical point of the
                substance, which is the highest temperature and pressure at which a gas and a liquid can coexist at
                equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Gibbs Phase Rule</h2>
            <p>J. W. Gibbs derived an equation from thermodynamic considerations that enables the number of phases that
                can coexist in equilibrium in a chosen system to be computed. This equation, called Gibbs phase rule,
                can be represented as follows:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">P + F = C + 2</p>
            <p>where P is the number of phases which coexist in a chosen system; C, the number of components in the
                system and F is the degrees of freedom.</p>
            <p>A phase is a region of system with the same structure and uniform composition and differs from other
                regions of the system either in structure and/or composition.</p>
            <p>The component is a chemical constituent (element or compound) of a system, which may be used to specify
                its composition.</p>
            <p>The degrees of freedom are the number of variables (pressure, temperature and composition), which can be
                changed independently without changing the state of the phase or phases in equilibrium in a chosen
                system. Let us apply the Gibbs phase rule and calculate the degrees of freedom at the triple point of
                pressure-temperature phase diagrams of water (point B in Figure 3.1). At the triple point, three phases
                coexist in equilibrium, thus P=3; and since there is one component in the system (water), C=1, the
                number of degrees of freedom can be calculated as under,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">P + F = C + 2</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">or,</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">3 + F = 1 + 2</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">F = 0 {zero degree of freedom</p>

            <h2> Time-Temperature Transformation (TTT) Diagram</h2>
            <p>The time-temperature transformation (TTT) curves correspond to the start and finish of transformations,
                which
                extend into the range of temperatures where austenite transforms to pearlite. Above 550°C, austenite
                transforms completely to pearlite. Below 550°C, both pearlite and bainite are formed and below 450°C,
                only
                bainite is formed. The horizontal lines that run between the two curves, as shown in Figure 6.2, marks
                the
                beginning and end of isothermal transformations. The TTT diagrams provide a good starting point for an
                examination of hardenability, but as they are statements of the kinetics of transformation of austenite
                carried out isothermally, they can only be rough guides. To take an example, the TTT diagrams for a
                0.4%C
                0.2% Mo steel and steel with 0.3%C 2% Mo show that the 0.2% Mo steel begins to transform in about one
                second
                at 550°C, but on increasing the molybdenum to 2%, the whole C-curve is raised and the reaction slowed
                substantially so that the nose is above 700°C, the reaction starting after four minutes. The latter
                steel
                will clearly have a greatly enhanced hardenability over that of the 0.2 Mo steel.</p>

            <p>The Constant-Cooling-Temperature (CCT) diagram, as shown in Figure 6.3, describe the transformations
                taking place at various constant cooling rates. The later diagrams resemble more closely the conditions
                during the actual production process of the steel or during its heat treatment at a later stage. The CCT
                diagrams provide not only the information on the transformation start and finish conditions, but also on
                the resulting hardness and microstructures for each particular cooling curve.

            <h2>Definition of Heat Treatments</h2>
            <p>Heat treatment is the controlled heating and cooling of metals to modify their physical and mechanical
                properties without changing the shape of the product. Heat treatment is sometimes done unintentionally
                due to manufacturing processes that either heat or cool the metal such as welding or forming.</p>
            <p>Heat treatment is associated normally with increasing the strength of material, but it can also be used
                to alter certain objectives, such as, improve machining, improve formability, and restore ductility
                after a cold working operation. Thus, it is a very useful manufacturing process that not only helps
                other manufacturing processes, but also improves the product performance by increasing strength or other
                desirable characteristics. Steels are particularly suitable for heat treatment, since they respond well
                to heat treatment and the commercial use of steels exceeds that of any other material. In the following
                sections, different aspects of heat treatment of steel are dealt with. Steels are heat treated for one
                of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>softening,</li>
                <li>hardening, and</li>
                <li>materials modifications</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Softening</h3>
            <p>Softening is done to reduce strength or hardness, remove residual stresses, improve toughness, restore
                ductility, refine grain size or change the electromagnetic properties of steel.</p>
            <p>Restoring ductility or removing residual stresses is a necessary operation when a large amount of cold
                working is to be performed, such as in a cold-rolling operation or wiredrawing. Annealing (full,
                process, spheroidising, normalising) and tempering (austempering, martempering) are the principal ways
                by which steel is softened.</p>
            <h3>Hardening</h3>
            <p>Hardening of steel is done to improve the strength and wear properties. One of the pre-requisites for
                hardening is sufficient carbon and alloy content. If there is sufficient carbon content, then the steel
                can directly be hardened. Otherwise, the surface of the part has to be carbon enriched using some
                hardening techniques employing diffusion treatments. The ability to be hardened varies with the carbon
                and alloy content of steel. The higher the carbon content, the harder the steel can become. Low carbon
                steel has very low hardenability and wrought iron, which has no carbon, is unhardenable. To harden
                steel, it is heated above the "transformation point", a low red or just above where the steel becomes
                non-magnetic. Then it is quenched in brine, water, oil or even air. Afterwards, it is tempered by
                reheating. Hardenability is a measure of the depth to which steel will harden when quenched from its
                austenitizing temperature. In the Jominy end-quench test, the depth of hardening is the distance along
                the specimen from the quenched end which correlates to a given hardness level.</p>
            <h3>Critical Cooling Rate</h3>
            <p>The critical cooling rate is defined as the slowest rate of cooling from the hardening temperature, which
                will produce the fully hardened martensitic condition.</p>
            <h3>Material Modification</h3>
            <p>Heat treatment is used to change properties of materials in addition to hardening and softening. These
                processes modify the behaviour of steels in a beneficial manner to maximize service life (for example,
                stress relieving) or strength properties (for example, cryogenic treatment) or some other desirable
                properties (for example, spring aging).</p>
            <h2> Common Heat Treatments for Steels</h2>
            <h3>Full Annealing</h3>
            <p>Full annealing is the process of slowly raising the temperature about 50°C above the austenitic
                temperature line A3 or line ACM in the case of hypo-eutectoid steels (steels with < 0.77% carbon) and
                    50°C into the austenite-cementite region in the case of hyper-eutectoid steels (steels with> 0.77%
                    carbon) (Figure 6.3).</p>
            <p>It is held at this temperature for sufficient time for all the material to transform into austenite or
                austenite cementite as the case may be. It is then slowly cooled at the rate of about 20°C/h in a
                furnace to about 50°C into the ferrite-cementite range. At this point, it can be cooled in room
                temperature air with natural convection. The grain structure has coarse pearlite with ferrite or
                cementite (depending on whether hypo- or hyper-eutectoid). The steel becomes soft and ductile.</p>
            <h3>Normalizing</h3>
            <p>Normalizing is the process of raising the temperature to over 60°C, above line A3 or line ACM fully into
                the austenite range (Figure 6.4). It is held at this temperature to fully convert the structure into
                austenite, and then removed form the furnace and cooled at room temperature under natural convection.
                This results in a grain structure of fine pearlite with excess of ferrite or cementite. The resulting
                material is soft; the degree of softness depends on the actual ambient conditions of cooling. This
                process is considerably cheaper than full annealing since there is not the added cost of controlled
                furnace cooling. The main difference between the full annealing and the normalizing is that fully
                annealed parts are uniform in softness (and machinabililty) throughout the entire part; since the entire
                part is exposed to the controlled furnace cooling. In the case of the normalized part, depending on the
                part geometry, the cooling is non-uniform resulting in non-uniform material properties across the part.
                This may not be desirable if further machining is desired, since it makes the machining job somewhat
                unpredictable. In such a case, it is better to do full annealing.</p>
